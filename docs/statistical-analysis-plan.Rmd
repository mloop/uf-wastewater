# The data story

* These data on concentrations of different illicit drugs in wastewater near Ben Hill Griffith stadium were collected in September of 2018. 
* Water samples were collected at three separate sites near the stadium, starting at 6 PM and repeated every 30 minutes until 11 PM.
* The water samples were sent to the Oklahoma State Health Sciences Center to be analyzed for illicit drug compounds using mass spectometry.
  * To estimate the concentration of a compound in a sample of water, the mass spec instrument must suck up the samples into a machine to look at them and estimate the concentration. Some molecules that are large have a hard time being read because they get stuck or can't go through the tube in order to get to where the measurement is taken. Thus, some compounds will always have a value of 0 concentration in the sample, and some will have a measured concentration that is below their true concentration.
* The results were then sent back to the University of Florida or University of Kentucky, depending upon where Chris Delcher was employed at the moment.
* Another replicate of all samples were tested.[@Dom: Is that correct?]
* The data was transformed by Dom, by hand, from the spreadsheet sent from OSUHSC to the structure needed for analysis.
